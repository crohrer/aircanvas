# AirCanvas
Drawing images using a kinect 3D-camera

## About this project

AirCanvas was a student project at [Stuttgart Media University](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/) in the 2011 course "Interfacegestaltung". The topic was ["IC-IC and Dancing with Information"](https://idblog.hdm-stuttgart.de/dancing-with-information/). The goal was an interactive installation at the half-yearly student event *Media Night*.
You can read more about AirCanvas on our old blog: https://idblog.hdm-stuttgart.de/aircanvas/

Sadly all our blogposts and even more sadly most of our Code is in *German*. Please forgive us - we didn't know better back then ;)
